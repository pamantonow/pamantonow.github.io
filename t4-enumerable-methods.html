      The enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods,  and with the ability to sort and in this case and enumerable is a module.
      The class must provide a method each which it blocks successive methods of the collection, must also provide a 
      meaningful operator.
      This method is very similar as hashes and arrays but it makes your code prettier and with fewer lines 
      example:
      <pre> 
      class Colors
    include Enumerable

    def each
    yield "red"
      yield "green"
      yield "blue"
    end
  end
</pre> 
    </p>
    <p>
        There is different types of enumerables but I am going to focus on the enumerable#map, map returns  a new array with the results of running block once for every element. Although #map is almost the same as collect , obviously just named different and it could work for an array and a hash .
        Let's say that you want to modify you array without altering the original this also when you can just this method.
        Example</p>
        <pre>
          ark2 = ['cat', 'dog', 'pig', 'goat'].map do |animal| 
         animal.capitalize
         animal.upcase   
          end
         puts ark2.join(", ")   #=>   "CAT, DOG, PIG, GOAT"
        </pre>
       <p> In the example above you are creating an array with name of animals inside, then using .map to collect the results
        for the running block once for every element, then we capitalize it and put everything upcase, by using animal.capitalize and animal upcase don't forget that every time you do a loop you have to close the  loop, last but not least we put the array name using puts follow by the name of the array using .join to put an specific element in between in this case is the " ,".</p>
