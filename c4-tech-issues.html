  <h2>Diversity in tech</h2>
  <h4>August 23rd , 2015</h4>

      As some people know the diversity in the Tech community has a huge gap in between females to males and another nationalities , I understand this the most specially since I am part of the two minorites in IT .
      I am Latino female which is around 6% of the females who code, around 69% the women programmers are white which 
      this makes me the minority in Tech and is a little sad that such a little percentage of Latino women are working 
      in the IT field.

       According to Harvard Business school is less likely that females to be given bonuses in comparison with 
       men with equivalent perfomance reviews, apparently the senior leaders are serious about diversity genders and 
       break the stereotypical view of the ideal programmer.
       There is also some harassment towards the women becuase they think that our emotions are going to be mixed up 
       during work, and often companies will rather hire a man due to the fact that they think are more "competitive"
       and "assertive".</p>
      <p> The president is trying to see ways of fixing that gender gap which he think that it might require more scholarships and equal treatment for both genders.
       A senior leader at Microsoft and amazon interviewed around 712 females who held tech positions in almost 600 companies asking them the main reason of leaving the company  and 27% of this females said because they 
       felt discomfort and discrimination based on the race, sexual orientation and age was the main reason of them leaving this job.</p>

        I am little scared but at the same time confident of perhaps working on a change and bring up that percentage of
        the Latino female working in tech , and proving that age and and race has nothing to with your job perfomance I might be young however I could use my age on my favor becuase I usually learn things faster and the adaption is pretty easy to get over with. 
        I feel that is time to show what we are capable and for the CEO's or the employers to put an end into this discrimination towards the females and give us that opportunity givin our 100% without having to worry of feeling discomfort or knowing that the males are getting pay more than us doing the same job task with same perfomances.
