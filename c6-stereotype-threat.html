      As the title says it this post it's going to be about stereotypes, and here in the U.S you will see plenty of it,
      that was the first thing I noticed when I moved here , specially since I am from Mexico people will have random thoughts as "Did you cross the border?", "How did you survive with all those drug dealers" and many other comments that I come accross.
      I learned to ignored them but to be honest it was a blessing that I grew up in another country because this helped to
      not stereotype any race , color, sexuality just a person becuase your nationality doesn't mean that you fit in that typical stereotype that media gives us.

      Entering the Tech world is exciting yet little terrifying for several reasons one is that I am latina , second I am female this two will bring me more challenging situations because appareantly research says that from females programmers only 6% are latinas, very little isn't it?.
      The other factor is the way that people portray Mexican people as lack of education, coming here becuase of drug dealing problems and generally people think and see us as this little dark people that sales tacos or make amazing 
      mexican food.
      The last factor that I have been dealing ever when going to meetups is that I am very much into fashion therefore I dressed up all the time, my job on the side besides working on DBC challenges is stylist , so often when I go to this meetups the people will look at me as I don't belong there or the guys will try to flirt, actually once someone said "Oh this is for programming , are you lost?", that comment made me furious.

      This tells you that people in Tech have a vision of programmers, and they stereotype based on the looks specially if is a women. 
      Through this time I kept thing how am I going to change that thought , how to prove myself and be taken serious, a lot of thoughts came to me and one of my solutions is to just listen to the positive constructive criticism , I know that I don't know much because my background is completely different, therefore the best that I could do is to give my 110% at all times.

        I want to show people that latinos we are smart people and break that stereotype that they have of us , my strategies that so far I had use with people is always being kind and very respectful , I had thought about also
        showing a little more of my culture and who we are as people that we are full of live but we are different from head to toe, same with every race there is a culture that unites but a personality that differentiate each individual.
