  <h1>Looping</h1>
  <h2>Loops Ruby vs looping Javascript</h2>
  <h4>Oct 2nd 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
    This our week 7 and Dev Bootcamp and we just started with Javascript after we did three weeks of Ruby , we learned a lot of methods but the most efficient one was learning how to loop on an array or a hash which you can do the same thing in Javascript to loop through an array or an object. I am going to explain how to loop with Javascript and Ruby since both of this languages are similar but have their different ways to loop.
    Although after being used to doing Ruby and using different loops there , Javascript was a little bit more confusing  and the syntax it's different but it's always good to learn different languages (to be honest I like Ruby a little bit more).

    </p>
    <p>
    Ruby has different loops you got :each,for,while,until and many more .. , the most common ones are using .each
    here is an example.Also in this example it's something that I used for one of my challenges and what this little piece of code its doing is defining a method and setting an array = to a number.to_s and splitting ,
    in this specific challenge we wanted to return a number a string of a comma every third digit, counting reverse, that is why I am using .each_with index to iterate over the index of the array and check if the index remainder 3 it's equal to zero.
        <pre> 
          def separate_comma(number) 
          array = number.to_s.reverse.split("")
            array.each_with_index do |num,index|
              if index % 3 == 0
              array[index] = "," + num
              end
            end
          end
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    I am using the same method that I did for Ruby but in Javascript and let's break it down first you create function
    with a function name and an argument you have curly brackets to start and the method(that is how Javascript works)
    when you are creating a variable don't forget to write var infront of it otherwise you will get an undefined method. Using for I am checking if the var index (index of an array) it's equal to 0 , then index less than the array length , increment the index.
    It works the same as the .each method Ruby but using for.
        <pre>
          function seperateComma(number) {
          var array = number.toString().split('').reverse();
           for (var index = 0; index < array.length; index += 1) {
            if (index % 3 == 0){
              array[index] += ","
            }
           }
         </pre>
