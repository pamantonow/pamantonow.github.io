     This week was my first one in Phase-0, and I learned how to set up Github, create repositories, knowing how to fork and clon,basically the essentials that every programmer needs to know, specially since GitHub it will be were you store your programs and work with people.
I am going to go more in details of why did I had to create a repository , since right now I am working and submitting work for Dev Bootcamp , it is much easier to creat my own repositories from the work that I have to submit that way , I do not interfere with the master branch, and is easier for my to find my own work . This when I learned about forking, when you fork something in Github this will create a copy of a project or material that is posted, this copy will for yourself as I said that way, you have your own work and don't interfere with someone else's.
We also have git which is really similar as Github , but is on your computer and you don't work with nobody else on that,
and there is three stages on git: git add, git status, git command .  The stages are for you to keep track of what changes you are doing on Github project.

        While I was learning how to write code , which was the most basic I had no idea what version control was, nor that I was going to use it. I understood the importance of using version control by doing a deep research and 
        knowing why is pretty essential to know it. 
        One of the videos that I saw while doing the research was comparing a programmer that did not used version control and one that it did , this programer was explaining that he had not make file for each change that he did, and sometimes it was 
        really hard to find your files

    <p>
        The best way to keep track of your projects, codes etc.. is using version control , you will wonder why
        version control? As the name says it controls , therefore you can keep track of your past projects and work with more 
        than one developer even do they are not in the same place as you, and this avoids coping and pasting , creating a bunch of files etc...
