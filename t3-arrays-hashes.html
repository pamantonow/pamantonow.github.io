      Arrays are ordered, it collects either a string which could be anything inside this symbols "" you could use many of this strings on an array but you have separate with (,) or also it could take a number or several of them in programming we call integer. 
      The arrays are a collections of indexed collections of any object, this being said an array indexing starts at 0 and it could also be negative numbers but it will end once it hits -1.
      Elements in the array can be retrived by using the [] method. It could take a single argument or multiple arguments, 
      as I mentioned before this means that you can put any object (as an integer or a string inside the [] brackets).
      Arrays are very useful when you to collect anything specific this will be the right method.

    </p>
    <p>
      We also have hashes which are a collection of key-value pairs, this are similar an array except that indexing is done unpredictable keys of any object type not an integer index.
      The order which you pass overa hash by either key or value it could be arbitrary and will generally not be in the insertion order.
      You can start the hash by writing your key-value pairs inside curly brackets 
      {}, although is really important that you pass a key and value in that order because if you only do key it will return nil which is an error , so does if you return only the value it will be nil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrays and hashes are similar concept but the use is completely different , the arrays you can view them by the order of the index, and the hashes have no order.
      Myself I will use hashes if I have method that requires getting a key and/or a value example :</p>
      <pre> hash {book1 => "harrypotter"}</pre>
      <p> , you could just easily find either just the value or the key depending on whatever the method is asking for.
      In the other hand we got the arrays , this will be the one that you want to use one order matters, you can loop through the arrays in order to find where the index is. Let's say that you need to make an array of integers, and you want to find which is the lowest integer, this method will work if you have no idea which one will be lowest here is two examples:</p>
      <pre>numbers = [1,2,4,5]</pre>
      <p>in this example we know the numbers in the array and we want to get the lowest number, that is when index comes in handy, here is you will do it</p>
      <pre>numbers[0]</pre>
      <p>In this array we do know which one is the lowest number, but if there is the case that the array was already created, and you need dont know the lowest number you can easily just write the name of the array and index of 0
