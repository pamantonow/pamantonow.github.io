    My thinking style it's concrete sequential, this type of thinking it's really logical all to the point , and following directions, to be honest after doing the quiz , I thought I have a little bit of everything I am good at following directions and I can rely on other to complete a task but at the same time , I enjoy working as a team that doesn't make me a concrete sequential thinker. The way that my thinking style will help in DBC is because I am little bit of everything and this is better because that means I could easily adapt, working in groups perhaps solo sometimes , accepting help of others or maybe helping someone all of this will be on my advantage at DBC to help me learn since I could think in different ways if is the need.

      When I stared with phase 0 my first struggle was following git and github , learning how to read the errors and how to push and pull, then week 2 it was a little easier because it had to do with html and css and I had a better a understanding on  this plus if I got stuck on how to write an specific tag or css I could possibly search it and find the correct answer.
      This was week 3 and it had to do with ruby, it was a little tedious but at the same time fun , having that excitement when you pass the code is the most fun part of writing the code, but as well with all the weeeks I did research a lot of research, also a little a tutoring . 
      One of my biggest struggle was that english is not my first language and learning how to put my ideas into line was a little complicated , I had though of several options to have my strategy work and one of them is working less to have more time to do research it seems to be working.
      I want to say that wokirking with pairs it was a learning process because people might know something that I do no not at this works perfectly to get a new knowledge or perhaps a new strategy.

    Mostly my way of thinking is a growth mindset, I like to embrace the challenges although it made be hard due to the language communication but nonetheless I embrace it after a little bit of putting thought to it, the best way to learn and face your fears is by my embracing a challenge is you avoid you will never really learn from the mistakes. 
    Although when it comes to critiscm if is negative definetely I will ignore it, because is NEGATIVE very different from constructive critism , this is the type will address perhaps something that you are doing wrong and tell you why , and how to fix without being rude or just negative towards whatever you are doing.
    I enjoy seeing other people successed , specially if is another woman or someone close to me  even if I do not know the person as if the person is successiding it's perfect! there is nothing better than becoming the best version of you but obviously for the right reasons anything that will have a positive impact in your life and you achieving then you are already achieving good goals.
