      You might be thinking of what is rails. Isn't rails like train rails or something like that?, but no in programming 
      rails is a web application development that is written by ruby, it will make your life easier yes that is right, meaning that you can create a website with less bla bla bla . How cool isn't it I will explain further more about this cool application that we all want to learn about , to make our work more efficient and of course less work , and at least myself I like less complex things and if it gets the works done even better!!!.
    </p>
    <h2>Why rails?</h2>
    <p>
        Rails is a popular and often used by developers because it's conventions are very clever, basicaly any web application that has html,or accessing data. Also ruby on rails it's an open source framework and is relatevily 
        new just like ruby you should have a dry code this means don't repeat yourself  and is conversition over configuration meaning that you have less choices but that is not bad becuase they show you the best ways to do it.
        Also part of my research forum as business insider and treehouse had mentioned that now companies will prefer rails since the saw that is more efficent to write, big corporations such as Facebook, and google use ruby on rails for the efficiency.

    <h2>How rails work</h2>
    <p>Web servers reads HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, either from steady files that are stored on the server, or from a server that creates files effectively using a programming language such as Ruby. A software program written in Ruby and organized using Rails conventions is a web application. Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application. Rails uses Ruby to effectively use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from component files. Although rails comes with a little potential problems such as the not every website host can suppost rails however this just few website that don't so you still have the ones that do.
