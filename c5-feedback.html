      I knew since the beginning of DBC that there was going to be pairing involve at least twice a week. They mentioned
      also in the handbook nothing really came to my mind except that I really like that idea specially because I might not
      be very good at programming and a lot of people that I pair already they have worked in something that is IT related,
      I am always questions to them when they know something that I don't because I want to learn and some things are easier to learn alone than other, for myself I love to learn new languages is that really easy learning by yourself
      but learning programming it could be challenging depending what's the person way to learn.

      Not until yesterday I didn't read none of the feedback that people had about me , I did when I couldn't see my way out from my solo challenge maybe to get inspire and feel more self-motivated all the feedback was pretty positive and I loved reading that people really enjoyed working with me. 
      Also I made me think of a different aspects, on the way of working I think right now I have the bad habit of not 
      reading the challenge until the pairing and for the most part the other person had thought already into it while
      myself I barely start thinking of how we are going to solve it .

        Writing feedbacks wasn't hard at all because I don't think I had a bad experience with nobody and I truly enjoyed working with everyone and getting to learn from them. One of the times I met with my pair at a coffee shop which was pretty fun! we got to share notes and meet the person of my cohort , we shared ideas and also talked about DBC and what we are looking forward to it. 
        Overall I don't mind at all working with someone else , and I am pretty excited of going to DBC because I heard
        that most of the time you are pairing with someone and I think I could learn a lot specially since I love to talk.
