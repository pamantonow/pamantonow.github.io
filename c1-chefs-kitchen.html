      When I got accepted to DBC I had mixed emotions, one of them as the video mentioned was fear, fear of failing specially since I do not know much about html or coding in general I thought and perhaps still think a little bit that some people might be more advance that I will, though I am going to give my 100 to be at the same pace withould falling behind.

        Although as far I know there will be a lot of people with about the same background as me which has nothing to do with tech, and that makes me feel more relief since I am afraid of failing.
        Before thinking of applying to DBC , I spent a good amout of time in there because someone that I knew went there and I went to their meetups, sometimes go and spend time there this made me see how the people and the environment is this bootcamp, that is why I applied the fact that the instructor and people will help get throught stuffs and understand the code.

        I am really excited for this new experience and to be a part of this rollercoaster adventure(since I think there will be ups and down , hopefully more ups), to meet the people and to take back a beautiful and learning experience in this nine weeks.
