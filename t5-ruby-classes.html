    <p>
      This week we did more Ruby classes, to be honest I thought it was little harder, and perhaps I went a little overwhelmed trying to figure out how to call the class and creating a new class. I think by breaking it down to pieces and explaining why do you need different method in the class work it will be much more helpful , here I am going to create a class an explain why do you need all those little things in the class.
      Let's think of a class as blueprint, which this will tell ruby how things have to be structure although without any 
      details the class won't work. 
    </p>
        <pre>
          class Name
            def initiliaze(first_name,last_name)
            @first_name = first_name
            @last_name = last_name
            end
          end
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above I created a class called Name, just a reminder whenever you create a class the name of your class always has to be the first letter capital.
          The next line I am defining a method called initialize and as argument , I am passing a first name and a last name , right below them I am creating and instace of the argument and setting equal to the name of it, if your variable doesn't start with the symbol @ this is consider a local variable.
    </p>
    <pre>
      class Name
            def initiliaze(first_name,last_name)
            @first_name = first_name
            @last_name = last_name
            end
        def first_name
         print "Lucia"
        end

         def last_name
         print "Antonow"
         end
        end
        name = Name.new
        puts name.first_name
        puts name.last_name
    </pre>
    <p>
        In the code above I added few methods, one is a methos using the argument inside the initialize which is first_name and the second method is using last_ name, in both of this methods I am just printing my first name.
        In the next line I  instantiate the class and set it equal to a new class, this by defaul it will make it run, 
        then to run the other to method I called them by write puts + the name of the class and using .first_name or viceversa is to puts what is inside of that method.
