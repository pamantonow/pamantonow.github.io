      Hi everyone!
      
      Since the first thing that you see is my projects that I have done so far at dev bootcamp , I feel that perhaps haven't really said much about myself, the person who is behind all this posts. 
      I grew up in Mexico and lived there for 15 years of my life , then after that I moved to Los Angeles for a change
      pretty much I am a wanderlust , never ever can't settle anywhere because I always have that desire of traveling it was very difficult at first not really knowing people and the culture is much different.
      While growing up I wasn't really sure of what I wanted to do with my life, I thought I wanted to be a prosecutor (that is what happens when you watch law & order to much.)
