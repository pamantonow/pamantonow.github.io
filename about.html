      Hi everyone!
      
      Since the first thing that you see is my projects that I have done so far at dev bootcamp , I feel that perhaps haven't really said much about myself, the person who is behind all this posts. 
      I grew up in Mexico and lived there for 15 years of my life , then after that I moved to Los Angeles for a change
      pretty much I am a wanderlust , never ever can't settle anywhere because I always have that desire of traveling it was very difficult at first not really knowing people and the culture is much different.
      While growing up I wasn't really sure of what I wanted to do with my life, I thought I wanted to be a prosecutor (that is what happens when you watch law & order to much.)

      I worked in fashion for 5 years(I didn't study it) although I always had a love for it, following desingers dressing people out that was part of my job styling them depending on body type but all of my different passions makes who I am.
      I like challenging myself , not very sure if is a bad thing or not but I am always trying to be the best version of me when I decided to study to become a programmer I thought it was going to be a bit difficult since I first I'm a female and second latina.
